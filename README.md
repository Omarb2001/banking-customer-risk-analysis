# Consumer Credit Risk Clustering & Dashboard

## Project Summary

- Applied KMeans clustering to consumer financial records to segment applicants into 4 demographic groups.
- Analyzed financial behaviors such as credit amount, employment duration, and savings/checking balances.
- Identified correlations between cluster characteristics and likelihood of loan default.
- Built a Power BI dashboard highlighting group size, loan purpose, housing, default risk, and key indicators.
- Delivered strategic insights for credit risk profiling and potential policy adjustment.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL (for exploration & filtering)
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development and storytelling
- **Excel**: Preprocessing & pivot summaries
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control & hosting

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- Group B, consisting younger applicants with moderate income and short employment history showed **34.15% loan default**, flagged as **High Risk**.
- Group D, consisting of older applicants with strong savings and long credit durations had **12.77% default**, classified as **Low Risk**.
- Default rates above **30%** were labeled "High Risk," between **20â€“30%** as "Moderate," and below **20%** as "Low."
